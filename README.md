Primenumbers
============

Primenumber search &amp; performance check

A small console test to find primenumbers, a common task given during job interviews.

First method through a simple enumeration then through Sieve of Eratosthenes (SoE).
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes for details.

SoE method is performed twice. Once using Objective-C NSMutableArray then using C-array. 
Methods are timed to compare performance.
